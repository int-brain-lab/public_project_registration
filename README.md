# Public project ideas

Welcome to the IBL public-facing ideas repository! Under the 'Issues' tab you'll find a list of project ideas that can be done using publicly available IBL data.

### Rules
* If you're interested in a project, please reply to the corresponding Issue with your name, affiliation and the approximate timewindow in which you plan to work on it. It's completely fine to work on the same project as someone else!
* As you're generating results, please share any publicly available code/figures/preprints on the Issue as well. We encourage open science, but if you'd rather not share everything immediately you can also add a placeholder (e.g. I'm writing my undergraduate thesis and will post it in August) to the Issue.
* Make sure to cite the IBL dataset that you're using, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.17.909838 for behavioral training data.
